# Release 2.6.2

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Added `charactersToEscape` to the JwtAuthProvider config. If the user ids, generated by your custom provider
contain characters that need to be url encoded, use this to replace invalid characters with `_` and generate a
`userId` that is valid for ROS purposes.

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.6.1

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an issue with `ros init` not installing the typescript dependency and subsequently, `npm start` failing.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.6.0

### Breaking changes
* The `DELETE auth/user/:userId` endpoint is now deprecated and will be removed at a later version. Instead use
`DELETE auth/users/:userId` (`user` is now plural - `users` to align with the other endpoints mounted on `auth`).

### Bugs fixed
* In clustered scenarios, `/health` should report the overall health of the cluster. If interested in
the health of a single instance, pass `?thisInstance=true` as query string.

### Enhancements
* Expose configuration options for the JWT Auth Provider to allow customizing the names of the `userId` and `isAdmin` fields.
* Adds an optional `requiredAttributes` option to the JWT Auth Provider, allowing filtering of JWT tokens.

  were bring created on each connection.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Re-enabled https tests in realmjs-integration
* Added new lint rule: no-trailing-whitespace

# Release 2.5.0

### Breaking changes
* Some methods and properties that are considered internal API have been marked private. This will show
up as compilation errors for typescript projects where they are accessed. While their usage is discouraged,
you can temporarily silence the errors by using the bracket notation. For example, `server.realmFactory.open`
can now be invoked by replacing it with `server['realmFactory'].open()`. Ultimately, you should move your
project to use only the public API.
* The following classes have been renamed:
  * `Console` -> `ConsoleLogger`
  * `File` -> `FileLogger`
  * `FileConsole` -> `FileConsoleLogger`
  * `AzureAuthServiceConfig` -> `AzureAuthProviderConfig`
  * `CloudkitAuthProviderParams` -> `CloudkitAuthProviderConfig`
  * `GoogleAuthServiceConfig` -> `GoogleAuthProviderConfig`
  * `PasswordAuthParams` -> `PasswordAuthProviderConfig`
  * `Mute` -> `MuteLogger`
  * `ServerStartParams` -> `ServerConfig`

### Bugs fixed
* Tokens without expiration date can now be revoked.
* Admin.json will now correctly be written, even if you provide custom private and public keys.

### Enhancements
* Expected HTTP access log entries are now logged on the "debug" level to avoid flooding the "info" log level.
HTTP responses with status code 400 or above are now logged on "detail" level.
This silence the verbose "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1 200" entries.
* Expose a configuration option - `writeAdminTokenToJson` on `ServerConfig` that controls whether the admin token
will be written to `data/keys/admin.json`.

* Expose `jsonBodyLimit` in the `ServerConfig` interface to allow increasing the maximum request size.

### Internals
* Added basic performance tests for the password provider.
* Added tests that fails if fatals, errors or warnings are logged during startup and shutdown.
* Added a `test:watch` script that allows watching for file changes and running the tests with coverage.
* RealmFactory.ts now warns if all realms open was not closed before closing the factory.
* Added Typescript interfaces for service types
* Added Histogram StatsSink metric type
* Now tracking sync proxy connection durations with StatsSink

# Release 2.4.2

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Sometimes (and usuallly when starting ROS), an unnecessary warning was logged:
'warn: TokenValidator couldn't check if token was revoked: The TokenRevocationRealm wasn't opened.'
It no longer is.
* Fixed a bug in RealmFactory where nonfatal errors would reject opening a Realm.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Admin tokens used internally are now irrevocable.

# Release 2.4.1

### Breaking changes
* None

# Release 2.4.0

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an issue that allowed non-admin users to create Realms in other users'
home folders.
* Fixed a bug causing the failover logic in SyncProxyService to trigger for
  no good reason. This would manifest itself in "End of input" error messages
  on the client in enterprise/cloud deployments.

### Enhancements
* Added `server.ensureRealmExists` API to create a Realm if it doesn't exist
already.

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.3.0

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* None

### Enhancements
* Indicate the version of ROS using `X-Powered-By` Header.
* Added `Server.applyPermissions` method to allow changing permissions without
having to log in with an admin user.

### Internals
* Refactored and renamed the PermissionsService.
* Temporarily disabled the deletion tests.
* Added a linter rule to force access modifiers.
* Upgraded realmJS to 2.1.1 and realm-sync to 2.1.10

# Release 2.2.0

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Export the JWT provider

### Enhancements
* Export stats classes and interfaces

### Internals
* Require labelNames in StatsSink metrics, which is needed for a downstream feature
* Allow configuring of a server's statsSink and statsStorage components.
* Changes the publish process to save a release notes file for later use (making a github release).
* Enabled module name case checks in tsconfig to prevent from hidden errors
  caused by case-sensitivity.
* Use && to chain commands in the build command line. This allows it to report
  failure on any step, not just the last one.

# Release 2.1.1

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed an import statement to make it work on case-sensitive file systems (Linux).
* Fixed a bug rendering `ros backup` useless because of incomplete path
  resolution for `realm-backup`.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals

  crypto key length. Reduced the crypto key length in tests to avoid timing out.

# Release 2.1.0

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The LogService will now respect token revocations (#735)
* Revoked tokens will now never be assigned to the req.authToken.

### Enhancements

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.23

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixes MixpanelService issue for Enterprise where some stats might not be available until
  the sync proxy is fully running.

### Enhancements
* Added JWT authentication provider. It allows you to create a custom
  authentication service that issues signed Json Web Tokens that contain a
  `userId` and optional `isAdmin` fields. The app then transmits the token to
  ROS which verifies the signature and authenticates a user with the provided
  `userId`.

### Internals
* Deleting a Realm that is required for ROS to function is now rejected (#737 fixing #734).
* Fixed a race condition in permission tests causing it to fail consistently
  on slow machines.
* Discovery tags for sync now use a descriptor, e.g., role=master or label=default.

# Release 2.0.22

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The health service no longer responds with 200 OK unless the server has fully
  started. It is 503 in case the server is still loading.
* The admin token user can now apply permission changes successfully.
* The early log messages do not get skipped in Studio any more.
* Users now have read-write access to their `/~/__permission` realms (again).
  The recent switch to read-only was an unintended breaking change.
* Fixed a potential race in the permission service. It reported itself started
  before setting up all the listeners and granting default permissions.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug where deleted-then-recreated objects with identical
  primary keys become empty.
* [Object Server] Fixed a bug in outward partial sync to ensure
  convergence of partial sync in the case where the client creates a primary key object, that is already present on the server, and subscribes to it in the same transaction.
* Added error handling to the internal requests to the load balancer. This
  should fix some unhandled promise rejections.

### Enhancements
* TypeScript and JavaScript templates now have .gitignore

### Internals
* The logger will now accumulate early log messages until a listener
  (i.e. the LogService) is attached. Or it will explicitly say that they had
  to be skipped, in case the listener didn't attach for a very long time.
* ROS will grant read-write permissions on `/~/__permission` to all users upon
  startup.
* Updated realm-js to 2.0.11 ans Sync to 2.1.7
# Release 2.0.21

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Close all Permission Realm files used to avoid running out of file handles.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.20

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Welcome static files are now served with `ros init`

### Enhancements
* Spinner is included during dependencies installation of `ros init`

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.18

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Realms with invalid paths are now rejected. Previously ROS would just create
  unsyncable realms.
* Realms with invalid paths are now skipped during 1-to-2 migration. This is
  required because ROS-1 has the same behavior creating unsyncable realms, which
  we are not going to fix.
* Non-existent data files are not copied during 1-to-2 migration.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443
* HTTPS key and cert are now validated before attempting to start
* server.shutdown() is now more forgiving in failed state scenarios

### Enhancements
* Server now has a simple method called `openRealm` that takes a remote path, like `/__admin` for example. This is always opened up with the internal server admin user. The schema is optional. 

### Internals
* Release process now removes the internal release notes from public releases.  If it works, this line
  will not show up on https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

# Release 2.0.17

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The migration tool now also migrates global realms.
* The default port for BasicServer's https is now properly set to 9443

### Enhancements
* There are two new special realms where permissions are reflected.
  `/<userid>/__perm` contains user-specific permissions and `/__perm` contains
  wildcard permissions. The old special realms are still available and reflect
  the same permissions, but they might contain duplicates. They are only there
  for compatibility and will be removed in the future.
* `ros migrate` will copy realm files by default. Specify `--norealms` to disable that.
* Added notice to users about the long time 'ros init' can take.
* Updated realm-js to version 2.0.5

### Internals
* The user-specific permissions are now also reflected into `/<userid>/__perm`.
  The difference from `/<userid>/__permission` is that `__perm` has a primary
  key, which allows the merge algorithm to eliminate duplicates. The same
  changes were made to wildcard permission realm: the new version with primary
  key is `/__perm`. The old paths are still accessible and will contain
  duplicates as before. This was also a chance to name those realms
  consistently, which we did. So, the mapping from old to new is:
    `/<userid>/__permission` -> `/<userid>/__perm`
    `/__wildcardpermissions` -> `/__perm`
* Assert in Realm deletion unit test.
* Expose maxDownloadSize as a parameter to the server.

# Release 2.0.16

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a problem in the install script where nvm is installed by homebrew.
* Added note to install script reminding the user to use the correct Node.js version.
* Fixed an issue with exporting all custom realm symbols
* Added support Visual Studio Code debugging and running when generating a server setup with `ros init`
* Opening a partially synced Realm before the master Realm was created now works correctly
* Terms of service is now persisted under the user's home directory. Fixes \#550

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Updated the TS and JS templates to be easier to modify.
* Terms of service now generates a distinctId as a UUID and uses that in all mixpanel events. Fixes \#600
* Adding Mixpanel Usage Stats with Incremental timer
* Adds simple stats collection interfaces, loosely matching that of prom-client, a Prometheus stats
  emitter. In developer edition, metrics are stored in-memory, allowing mixpanel to access them.
* Adds ROS usage by emitting to mixpanel data about the connections that go through the SyncProxyService
* Exposes mix panel interface by gating it behind setting a distinctId. This is typically loaded from
  the agreement file.
* Created a MixpanelService which handles emitting stats periodically to mixpanel.


# Release 2.0.15

* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed a bug preventing from migrating from ROS1 when `cluster_node_id` is
* Fixed a bug in SingleProcessDiscovery where find by tag returned unexpected
  results
* Fixed a bug in PermissionService where the listeners could potentially
  operate on missing or invalidated objects
* Return a proper error when using the admin token to make permission changes
  where the userId might not exist.
* Made sure that all symbols in `./realms/**/*.ts` are now exported

### Enhancements
* None

* THe 1-to-2 migration now checks that the destination directory is empty and
  fails with a message about that if it is not an empty dir.
* Expose the ROS port on the Docker container, to work with `docker run -P` for exposing on a random port.

### Internals
* None

# Release 2.0.12

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* The LogService WebSocket endpoints now needs an authentication message with a valid access or refresh token, within
  the first second of connecting to them. Realm Studio sends this message starting from v1.3.0.

* Fixed bug in CloudKit auth provider: https://github.com/realm/realm-object-server/issues/282
* Make releases on public repo
* Update private repository name
* New changelog workflow

## 2.0.7

### Breaking changes
* None

### Bugs fixed
* Fixed several possible race conditions during server start and stop.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Introduces a timeout function which will race a regular promise. This is crucial for avoiding deadlocks in service requests.
* SyncProxyService now uses a shared cache of backend promises, creating less work when multiple connections for the same realm happen at the same time. Also avoids race conditions in this case.
* Introduced a RealmFactory class which can provide access to Realms on backend sync workers. This is now separated from the Server class.
* Introduced ServerState, which is used to prohibit request processing when a service is not completely ready. This avoids some race conditions, mostly during shutdown. Possible fix for #327.
* discovery.watchService will now fire an available event if the service is available when called. This simplifies a lot of situations where this is done by the caller.

### Enhancements
* None

### Internals
* Fix the flaky permission tests


## 2.0.0-rc.11

### Fixed Bugs

* Log level from command line is propagated to sync server.
* Public and private key from the command line are used by the server.


## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Enhancements

* Added register argument to server.getSyncedRealm. This ensures that the
  SyncedRealm is not persisted in the cache.

### Fixed Bugs

* Ensure that services that require SyncedRealms have all required data before
  serving requests


## 2.0.0.rc9

### Breaking changes

### Fixed bugs
* SyncProxyService: Fixed an issue when using sharded sync workers
* Fixed the issue when a synced realm used internally would be undefined or
  invalidated because of sync worker unavailability.

### Internals

* Changed the SyncedRealm class to return a Promise<Realm>. Once it resolves,
  the Realm is there, with valid syncSession which does not get destroyed when
  the sync worker fails over. It utilizes the new override_server() API to
  make the session reconnect to the new sync worker.
* Fixed all the other parts of ROS which use SyncedRealm. Some functions become
  async because of that.
* Changed the way the server starts and stops. Now there is no barrier between
  starting services and registering them. This is required, because now some
  services, in order to start, wait for the Sync service to register.
* Update JS to RC22 and Sync to 2.0.2
* Updated the schema for `/__wildcardpermissions` to match the `/~/__permission` Realms, using `userId = *` for these `Permission` objects.

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Fixed bugs
* Fixed a bug in HTTPS support (sync proxy) [\#512](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/512)

  name in it is now just `Permission` instead of `StarSpecificPermission`.
* All users now have read-only access to `__wildcardpermissions` on startup [\#431](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/431)
* Grantor permission are reflected [\#491](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/491) and [\#427](https://github.com/realm/ros/issues/427)
* If attempting to change permissions with a metadata value matching no users, an error is thrown instead of stalling forever.
